## 2024 MDDN342 Assignment 3: Data Mappings

REPLACE ALL TEXT IN THIS FILE

This README should be used to document your design.

13/05
Began working on making owl face based on Kristoffer Zetterstrand's painting "Lemons & Owl" (https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GMeVdX_aAAACJKo.png). The outline is roughly compelte. It is missing eyes, ears, and the beak.

16/05
Welp it's no longer an owl. I might try to make it look like some low poly rigid frog, e.g. the eyes will be squares instead of circles.

I was planning on just porting my faces over from my previous project, but I got inspiration to make playing card faces instead. But then I was hit by a terrible idea: what if I just made kermit?

17/06
Added a new method which allows the code to know whether a face is facing left, right, or dead in the middle.

18/05
Made some minor adjustments to the positioning of the face. I plan on adding some additional details like spots (even though they are not part of the original design), which will be drawn based on a given face (I haven't decided how). Still need to make the line that goes through the pupil somehow, and maybe some neck details.

19/05
Made the line that goes through the pupil's curve. Also made a slider which controls the horizontal position of the pupils.

21/05
Changed eye shift slider to eye size slider.
